# Implementation Details

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Technologies
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core web technologies for the application
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework used for responsive design
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for visual elements
- **Puter.js**: Integration with Puter.ai for image analysis

### Key Components
- **Camera Integration**: Full camera access with error handling and loading states
- **AI Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompts for consistent JSON responses from the AI
- **Localization System**: Multi-language support with region-specific sorting rules
- **History Management**: Local storage implementation with image compression
- **Analytics**: Privacy-first tracking system for usage patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach optimized for totem-style displays

## Application Flow

1.  **Initialization**: On load, the app checks for camera access, network status, and loads user preferences (language, region) and historical data from local storage.
2.  **Camera Stream**: If camera access is granted, the live video feed is displayed. Users can capture an image.
3.  **Image Processing**: The captured image is resized and compressed for efficient transmission and storage.
4.  **AI Analysis**: The processed image and a structured prompt are sent to the Puter.ai API for waste classification.
5.  **Result Display**: The AI's response, including item identification, primary/secondary bins, confidence levels, and reasoning, is displayed to the user.
6.  **History Storage**: The scan result, along with the compressed image, timestamp, and selected language/region, is saved to local storage.
7.  **User Actions**: Users can share results, save images, or retake photos. Offline functionality is supported via the Service Worker.
